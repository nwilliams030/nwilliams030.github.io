# About the author and this site

I'm Alex Payne. I go by `al3x` online. I've been writing here for many years, much longer than the trimmed-down [archive](https://al3x.net/archive.html) covers.

I'm a writer. I'm also a backer, in the form of [early-stage investments](https://angel.co/al3xpayne), donations to non-profit organizations, and loans to local small businesses. I volunteer and consult with political campaigns and non-governmental organizations from time to time, too.

I was co-founder and CTO of [Simple](https://www.simple.com/), an online bank. Before that I was one of the first employees at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/al3x), where I started their developer platform team. I've written code for campaigns, nonprofits, unions, a defense/intelligence contractor, and a variety of [open source projects](https://github.com/al3x). I coauthored _[Programming Scala](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033073.do)_ (O'Reilly, 2009), started the [Emerging Languages](https://al3x.net/2014/09/16/thoughts-on-five-years-of-emerging-languages.html) conference, presented at [events](/events.html) around the world, and have taught at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) and [Turing School](http://turing.io/). I was a founding board member of [Business For A Better Portland](https://www.bbpdx.org/).

I live in Oregon with my wife, [Nicole Brodeur](http://nicoleabrodeur.com), two cats, an anxious pit bull, and a rotating cast of foster dogs. I'm interested in political economy, animal rights and welfare, philosophy, the arts, and systems of all sorts. I enjoy mixing unexpected records for people, getting better at drumming, spending time outside, doing yoga, and meditating.
